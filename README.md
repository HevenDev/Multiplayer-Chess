**Chess Multiplayer**
A beginner-friendly implementation of a multiplayer chess game built with WebSockets. This project is designed to introduce key concepts of real-time applications, error handling, and scalability while keeping the code approachable for learners.

**Features**

üéÆ Real-Time Multiplayer: Play chess with another player in real-time.
üí° Beginner-Friendly: Clean and understandable codebase with comments for easy learning.
üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling: Extensive use of try...catch blocks to ensure code stability.
üåê WebSocket-Based: Implements stateful WebSocket connections for seamless real-time communication.
üîÑ Scope for Scalability: The project architecture allows for future enhancements.

**Tech Stack**

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js with WebSocket
Database (optional): Currently in-memory, can be replaced with a database for persistence.
Setup Instructions

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/HevenDev/Multiplayer-Chess
cd chess-multiplayer

**Install dependencies:**
npm install

**Run the server:**
npm start

**Open the game:**
Access the frontend by navigating to http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

**How It Works**
Connection Handling: Players connect via WebSocket, and the server manages game state.
Game Logic: Chess rules are validated server-side to ensure fair play.
Error Handling: The backend uses try...catch extensively to capture errors during game logic or communication.

**Example snippet for try...catch:**

try {
  // Handle game state update
  updateGameState(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error updating game state:", error);
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({ error: "Failed to update game state." }));
}

**Limitations**

**Server Crash**: Currently, game state is stored in memory. If the server crashes, all active games are lost.
**Stateful WebSocket**: The WebSocket connections are stateful, meaning they do not reconnect automatically after a crash.
Future Scope

**Persistence:**
Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store game state and user data.
Implement session recovery for interrupted games.

**Scaling**:
Use WebSocket load balancers like HAProxy or move to WebSocket-supported cloud services.
Consider stateless WebSocket alternatives like WebSocket over Redis.

**Enhanced Features**:
Add authentication and user profiles.
Implement AI for single-player mode.
Allow spectators to watch games in progress.
